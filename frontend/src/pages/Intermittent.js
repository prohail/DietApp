        <h2>What is Intermittent Fasting?</h2>
        <p className="fs-5 text-dark">
          Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods
          of fasting and eating. It doesn't focus on what you eat, but rather
          when you eat. There are several different methods of intermittent
          fasting, but the most common ones include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            16/8 Method: This involves fasting for 16 hours and restricting your
            eating window to 8 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            5:2 Diet: This approach involves eating normally for five days a
            week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the
            remaining two days.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternate-Day Fasting: This method involves alternating between
            fasting days and normal eating days.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
